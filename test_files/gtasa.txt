# This file, and gtasa.gxt next to it, are miniature files containing a handful of strings for GTA: San Andreas. These mostly correspond to the game's main menu. The gtasa.gxt is hand-made and contains the same strings, ordered the same way in the TDAT structure, but the keys in TKEY should be sorted ASCIIbetically, as the game seems to use a binary search to optimize accessing data. The order is a bit different, as I somewhat messed up the formation of the GXT file and couldn't be bothered enough to reorder each entry, but it should work regardless.
